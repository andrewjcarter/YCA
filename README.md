# YCA

## To run : npm run start
## To build : npm run build

Components should be created in the app subdirectory.
Front end is still in ReactJS, only the backend is in TSX.
On build, YCA/app, YCA/frontend, and index.ts are transpiled,
placed in YCA/build, and served statically - for now - on whatever
port is defined in index.ts
